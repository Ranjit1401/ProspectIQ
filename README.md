# AutoMateAI – Autonomous AI Executive Assistant

## 🚀 Overview

AutoMateAI is an autonomous multi-agent AI assistant designed to execute complex real-world tasks from a single user request.

Instead of acting like a normal chatbot, AutoMateAI breaks a task into multiple subtasks, delegates them to specialized AI agents, coordinates execution, and provides the final result to the user.

Example:
- Plan an entire trip within a budget
- Book flights and hotels
- Manage calendars
- Research information
- Generate documents
- Send emails
- Organize tasks

All through one conversational interface.
