    Wraps the full sales-intelligence pipeline (knowledge ingestion ->
    persona -> intent -> strategy -> guardrail) so the Supervisor/Router
    can treat it as just another agent instead of the frontend calling
    AssistantService directly.

    NOTE: AssistantService is imported lazily inside run(), not at module
    load time. AssistantService pulls in the persona/intent/strategy/
    guardrail agents, which each do `from app.core.context import
    context`. Since this agent is registered from inside
    app.core.context's own AppContext.__init__, importing
    AssistantService eagerly here would re-enter app.core.context while
    it's still mid-initialization (before the module-level `context`
    name exists) and raise a circular-import error. Deferring the import
    to run() means it only happens after the app has fully started.
